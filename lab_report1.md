*## 'cd' - change directory*
***

no arguments - Absolute path: (/Users/ericpalafox)
- While running 'cd' with no arguments, there is no output since we are trying to change directory but do not give an argument. This simply means that we will change directories into the current directory that we are in, hence nothing happens. 

directory - Absolute path (/Users/ericpalafox/Downloads)
- While running 'cd Downloads' with a directory (Downloads) as the argument, this will result in an output of the previous working directory along with the /Downloads appended since we have moved into the Downloads directory with the cd command.

file - Absolute path (/Users/ericpalafox/Downloads/test.txt)
- While running 'cd test.txt' we are trying to change directories into a file, however, this is not possible since we are changing the working directory and this cannot be a file. In this case we can see the output as "cd: not a directory: test.txt" since we can only use cd to change into different directories, not files.
